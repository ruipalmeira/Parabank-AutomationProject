# Parabank - QA Automation Project

## Description
This repository will store automated tests, being run against:
[Parabank mock webapplication](https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm)

This was done as part of an Automation Tester technical training, promoted by [Ricardo Maia](https://github.com/maiams)

This repository should give a rough idea of my thought process regarding QA/Automation challenges and be used as a demonstration of the skills required by a QA Engineer/SDET.
